# Quoter â†” Pipedrive Integration Research

## Overview
Researching Quoter's native Pipedrive integration to understand how we can leverage it for automated quote creation.

## Key Findings from Quoter Admin Interface

### Integration Configuration
- **Location**: Quoter Admin â†’ Integrations â†’ Pipedrive
- **Status**: Enabled and active
- **Data Flow**: Bidirectional (Quoter â†” Pipedrive)

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. **Automatic Data Synchronization**
- âœ… **Contacts**: When People are created in Quoter, contact info automatically added to Pipedrive
- âœ… **Organizations**: Organizations created in Quoter sync to Pipedrive (won't overwrite existing)
- âœ… **Deals**: When Quotes are created in Quoter, Deals are created in Pipedrive
- âœ… **Attachments**: PDF versions of quotes are attached to Pipedrive deals

#### 2. **Status Mapping** (Critical for Automation)
- **Pending** quotes â†’ **Send Quote/Negotiate** stage
- **Accepted** quotes â†’ **Send Contract/Invoice** stage  
- **Ordered** quotes â†’ **Contract Signed** stage
- **Fulfilled** quotes â†’ **Deposit Received** stage
- **Lost** quotes â†’ **Lost** status

#### 3. **Deal Integration**
- **Deal Title**: Can be set to Quote Number with optional prefix
- **Deal Amount**: Can be upfront or recurring amount
- **Overwrite Option**: New quote revisions update original Pipedrive deal

### ðŸŽ¯ **COMPLETE WORKFLOW DISCOVERED: Pipedrive Integration in Quote Creation**

#### **Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Search Pipedrive for People**: When creating a quote, can search Pipedrive for existing People/Organizations
2. **Select Person**: Choose from Pipedrive contacts (e.g., "Eric Kim (ID 3101)")
3. **Associate with Pipedrive**: Quote shows "This Quote is associated with Eric Kim (ID 3101) from Pipedrive"
4. **Select Deal**: Dropdown shows deals associated with that person (e.g., "2024-07-25-Comic Con-Lighten-Up-Venue 808 San Diego (Discovery)")
5. **Automatic Data Population**: Deal and contact data automatically populated from Pipedrive

#### **Key Integration Features:**
- âœ… **Pipedrive Search**: Can search and select Pipedrive contacts directly
- âœ… **Deal Selection**: Can select from deals associated with the chosen person
- âœ… **Automatic Association**: Quote automatically linked to Pipedrive contact and deal
- âœ… **Data Sync**: Contact and deal information automatically populated
- âœ… **Bidirectional Link**: Changes in either system propagate to the other

### Automation Potential

#### âœ… **What We Can Leverage**
1. **Deal Selector**: Quoter can look up Pipedrive deals directly
2. **Status Triggers**: Quote status changes trigger Pipedrive stage updates
3. **Bidirectional Sync**: Changes in either system propagate to the other
4. **Automatic Deal Creation**: Quotes create deals automatically
5. **Pipedrive Search**: Can search and pull data from Pipedrive during quote creation
6. **Deal Association**: Can associate quotes with specific Pipedrive deals

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Simplified Approach**
Instead of our complex API integration, we could:
1. **Trigger quote creation** in Quoter when sub-org is ready
2. **Use Pipedrive search** to find the associated person
3. **Select the specific deal** from the dropdown
4. **Let Quoter handle** all the data population and Pipedrive integration automatically
5. **Use native status mapping** for workflow automation

## Questions to Answer

1. **Can we trigger quote creation via API?** âœ… Likely possible
2. **How does the Deal Selector work?** âœ… Confirmed - dropdown shows associated deals
3. **Can we programmatically create quotes from Pipedrive deal IDs?** âœ… Should be possible
4. **What triggers initiate the integration?** Manual or API-driven

## Next Steps

1. **Research Quoter API** for quote creation with Pipedrive contact/deal IDs
2. **Test the complete workflow** (person selection â†’ deal selection)
3. **Document the simplified approach**
4. **Implement automated quote creation** using native integration
