# Quote Automation Requirements

## ‚úÖ Required Conditions for Quote Creation

### 1. **Deal Stage Requirement**
- ‚úÖ **Deal must be in "Send Quote/Negotiate" stage** (stage_id: 3)
- ‚úÖ This is the trigger point for Pipedrive automation

### 2. **Organization Requirements**
- ‚úÖ **Sub-organization created** with naming pattern "parent_org_name-####"
- ‚úÖ **Any owner** (not limited to Maurice Capillaire - supports company expansion)
- ‚úÖ **HID-QBO-Status = "QBO-SubCust"** (field_id: 289)

### 3. **Custom Field Requirements**
- ‚úÖ **Deal_ID field populated** (15034cf07d05ceb15f0a89dcbdcc4f596348584e)
- ‚úÖ **Parent_Org_ID field populated** (6b4253304d94302a6f387ce6bde138a6dad48026)
- ‚úÖ **Org_ID field populated** (f0587989f8f2671466b6be51e4a91248cdee1d68)

### 4. **QBO Integration Requirements**
- ‚úÖ **QBO-SubCust-ID field populated** (4024 - QuickBooks Id : SyncQ)
- ‚úÖ **QBO-Cust-ID field populated** (4024 - QuickBooks Id : SyncQ)

## üéØ Automation Workflow

```
1. Pipedrive Automation creates sub-org (Step 6)
2. Pipedrive Automation waits for Zapier/SyncQ (Steps 7-8)
3. Pipedrive Automation sets HID-QBO-Status = "QBO-SubCust" (Step 9)
4. OUR TRIGGER: Detect sub-org with status = "QBO-SubCust" (any owner)
5. Create quote in Quoter using native Pipedrive integration
6. Quote automatically associated with Pipedrive deal and contact
```

## üîç Detection Logic

```python
def is_ready_for_quote_creation(organization):
    """
    Check if organization meets all requirements for quote creation.
    Works for any owner, not just Maurice.
    """
    return (
        organization.get("454a3767bce03a880b31d78a38c480d6870e0f1b") == 289 and  # QBO-SubCust
        organization.get("15034cf07d05ceb15f0a89dcbdcc4f596348584e") is not None  # Deal_ID
    )
```

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

- [ ] Deal in "Send Quote/Negotiate" stage
- [ ] Sub-organization exists with correct naming pattern
- [ ] Organization has any owner (supports company expansion)
- [ ] HID-QBO-Status = "QBO-SubCust"
- [ ] Deal_ID field populated
- [ ] QBO integration fields populated
- [ ] Pipedrive automation completed (Steps 1-13)

## üö® Error Cases

- **Missing Deal_ID**: Organization created but no associated deal
- **Wrong Status**: HID-QBO-Status not set to "QBO-SubCust"
- **QBO Not Ready**: QBO integration fields not populated
- **Automation Incomplete**: Pipedrive automation still running

## üéØ Key Improvement: Owner Flexibility

**OLD APPROACH**: Hardcoded to Maurice Capillaire (ID: 19103598)
**NEW APPROACH**: Works for any owner - supports company expansion

This ensures the automation will continue working as your team grows!
